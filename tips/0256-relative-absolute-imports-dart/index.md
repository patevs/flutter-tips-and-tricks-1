# Relative & Absolute Imports in Dart

Did you know?

You can use absolute imports for reusable Dart files that are copy-pasted across projects.

This way, they are always imported correctly (as long as they live in the same location relative to the project root).

<!--
If you copy-paste Dart files to a new project, your imports will fail:
import 'package:old_app/src/constants/layout_breakpoints.dart';

You can Find & Replace package:old_app with package:new_app to fix them (annoying and not very scalable)

Alternatives

Relative imports:

import '../../constants/layout_breakpoints.dart';

Absolute imports:

import '/src/constants/layout_breakpoints.dart';

Absolute imports are handy for files that always live in the same location across multiple projects (e.g. /src/constants)

Consider this as a temporary solution. Reusable files should be moved into a common package (works best with monorepo setups).
